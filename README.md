### Portfolio
This is a compilation of some of my personal programming projects and Bachelor of Computer Science coursework that shows in part what I've been exposed to while studying computer science. I am currently in my last quarter of said program. Both projects in "Unity Projects" were personal projects not assigned by my program.

Check out the "C# Projects" section of this repo and [Raspberry Pi IR Remote](https://github.com/Cybotive/RaspPi-POST-IrRemote) for my more recent work. Additionally you're more than welcome to browse my homepage to check out my other public work.

**Note: A fair amount of files uploaded to this repo are from the first few quarters of my program (check "Last Modified" stamps) which serves as a time capsule into how I've developed.**

If you're curious why my profile picture at the time of this commit is a screen, check out [ARMwatch](https://github.com/Cybotive/ARMwatch) where I have a 5yr old repo for an Arduino-based smartwatch project (prototype).
