### Portfolio
This is a compilation of some of my personal programming projects and Bachelor of Computer Science coursework that shows in part what I've been exposed to while studying computer science. Both projects in "Unity Projects" were personal projects not assigned by my program.

Check out the "C# Projects" section of this repo and [Raspberry Pi IR Remote](https://github.com/Cybotive/RaspPi-POST-IrRemote) for my more recent work. Additionally you're more than welcome to browse my homepage to check out my other public work.

**Note: A fair amount of files uploaded to this repo are from the first few quarters of my program (check "Last Modified" stamps) which serves as a time capsule into how I've developed.**

If you're curious why my profile picture at the time of this commit is a screen, check out [ARMwatch](https://github.com/Cybotive/ARMwatch) where I have a very old repo for an Arduino-based smartwatch project.
