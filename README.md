### Portfolio
This is a compilation of my personal programming projects and Bachelor of Computer Science coursework that show some of my programming capabilities but more so what I've been exposed to while attending university. I am currently in my last quarter of said program.

Check out the "C# Projects" section of this repo for my more recent work.

**Note: A lot of the files uploaded are from the first few quarters of my program (check "Last Modified" stamps).**

Take a look at my homepage to check out my other public work.
