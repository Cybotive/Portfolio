Most likely due to the assignment being extra credit, the JavaDoc wasn't flawless.
When coding, I tried following the API to the "T", but later found out I needed to add variables
and such. So the variables I have set or don't have set were due to what the JavaDoc listed
and then whatever I needed to get the program to run. If I did this over I would declare all the
variables that correspond to the Excel document, and try to use all of them for versatility.

folder "utils" under "My Code" was what I wrote for a previous assignment or two to understand
what those built-in utilities actually do.

This was all done in CSCD210 Programming Principles I.
