This project was the last assignment in Programming 2. There was example code provided for LinkedList but I ended up building these classes from scratch.

The menu is self-explanatory and each option has a method named opt<#>() with some of them having helper methods in same class
or using utility methods from my LinkedList class. I originally implemented compatibility with Comparable but the get-even-list
method it easier to specify Integer.

I just looked over my code again and I forgot to check for positive in userIntInput(). And I forgot to handle a -1 return
where userIntInput() is used.
