This project was the last assignment in Programming 2. There was example code provided for LinkedList but I ended up building these classes from scratch.

The menu is self-explanatory and each option has a method named opt<#>() with some of them having helper methods in same class or using utility methods from my LinkedList class. I originally implemented compatibility with Comparable but the get-even-list method it easier to specify Integer
