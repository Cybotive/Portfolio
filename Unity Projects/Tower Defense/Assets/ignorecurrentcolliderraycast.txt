My solution was to turn off the collider before the raycast and turn it on at the end:

     for (int i = 0; i < sectorCount; i++) 
     {
     locations [i].GetComponent<CircleCollider2D>().enabled = false;
                     
     RaycastHit2D hit = Physics2D.Raycast (locations [i].transform.position, Vector2.up);
     .
     .
     stuff
     .
     .
     locations [i].GetComponent<CircleCollider2D>().enabled = true;
     }
