Terrain Test:
I made this project a while ago. It uses raycasting I believe, to see where the player is looking
the .exe called Rock Throwing I believe is the build where you can pick up rocks and throw them
back out (the more you carry, the slower you get. The key should be E but it is listed in the controls).s

Tower Defense:
This is a much more recent project, and my main accomplishment was programming the towers to
target the entities walking along the path. The targetting algorithm sees if its view is being
obstructed, as well as always choosing the most critical target. "TestMapAndPlayer.exe" is most
likely the most recent one (I am on Linux so I can't check right now).
