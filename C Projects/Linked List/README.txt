The commented #include at top of main.c is what I used to compile the program
during development. We were tasked to use "make" before turn-in.

We were given basic methods written and declarations of at least most of the methods I
ended up writing, but all in one .c file; I had to separate everything into 2 .c's and 1 .h

LinkedListString.c:
I wrote listCount, deleteElement, reverseList, and listAllDelete. Also did formatting of
my own code in there.

LinkedListString.h:
Everything in here was given to us, but I made a .h file from the method declarations and
cleaned up the formatting.

main.c:
Most of the code in here was given to me in that one .c file I mentioned earlier, but I
formatted it into this main.c file

makefile:
I used a template that my instructor had in a slide (which of course was all jumbled) and
replaced what I saw needed to be replaced in order to get "make" to compile my program
